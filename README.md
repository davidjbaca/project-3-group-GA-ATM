# Description:

ATM Works:

Prior to ATM Works, there has been no truly versatile solution on the marketplace for ATM owners. Recognizing a lucrative business opportunity, the team made a dashboard for ATM owners to track their ATMs' performances.

# Getting Started:

1. When you open the website, notice the login/signup options. Make an account if you don't have one to access the features.
2. Once you're logged in, make an ATM and then add relevant information such as any surcharge as well as its location.
3. Once you've created an ATM, click on it in your dashboard to then be able to add information such as cash inputs.
4. At any point later, you're able to edit and delete an ATM as well as delete an ATM's details.
5. Add as many ATMs as you want!

# User Stories:

1. As a user, I want a central dashboard to see all of my ATMs in one location when logged in.
2. As a user, I want to be able to add new ATM machine locations because I will be growing my business.
3. As a user, I want to add details to my new ATM when creating it such as, $amount started with, date put into operation, $surcharge fee per transaction, location address, $fee to location (if any).
4. As a user (admin) I want to be logged in to view only my ATM machines on a dashboard.
5. As a user, I want to be able to click on an ATM's link from my dashboard and then go to a new page with further detail about this specific ATM.
6. As a user (admin), I want to be able to embellish my list of ATMs such as by creating a new location, editing its info and removing it if we aren't doing business together anymore.
7. As a user, I want to be able to input monthly revenue for any ATM I want that will be listed on the page to keep track.
8. As a user, I want to be able to click on links at the top of the page to go to wherever I need to get to easily.
9. As a user, I want to be able to create a brand new account and be able to login and log out.
